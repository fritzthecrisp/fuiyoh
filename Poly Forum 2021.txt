SDG 8: â€œHow might we support vulnerable groups in seeking and maintaining employment, given that ?"



how to encourage people to sign up for an experience with PwDs despite their stigma?
-- show what PwDs can do
  --myths debunked
-- not disclose PwD
-- incentives
-- celebrities 
-- do things that people think they cannot do
-- paralympic guests
-- hope?



1. Removing the stigma against PwDs
2. we would not want pwd to feel excluded(they wouldn't want to feel excluded)

main feedback/questions gathered: 
how to mentor??
will people be interested (in our case, people should be employers)?? PwD is a given cos we are helping them to be accepted. 
resource expensive
adequate enough to destigmatize?
money from where?


suggestions: honing PwD skills more; world skills for PwDs; story sharing
special: 340, 344,
